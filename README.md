A simple Python script that organizes files in a folder by moving them into subfolders based on their file types.

## How it works  
The script checks the files in the folder you specify and moves them into folders like `Images`, `Documents`, `Music`, etc., depending on their file extensions.

## How to use  
1. Change the `folder_to_organize` variable in `file_organizer.py` to the path of the folder you want to organize.  
2. Run the script with Python 3:
3. The files will be moved into new folders inside the original folder.

## Requirements  
- Python 3  
- No extra libraries needed

## Example output  
Moved: photo.jpg -> Images  
Moved: song.mp3 -> Music  
Skipped: randomfile.xyz (no matching folder)  
Done organizing!
